/*You have entered a Maze and need to find your way out of it. There are more than one possible paths through the Maze to the single exit point. Write a recursive function that will help you find a possible path through the maze.

You can use the following mazes to test your program.

let mySmallMaze = [
    [' ', ' ', ' '],
    [' ', '*', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', 'e']
];

let maze = [
    [' ', ' ', ' ', '*', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    ['*', '*', ' ', '*', ' ', '*', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    [' ', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'e']
];

For the above maze, a possible exit path can be RRDDLLDDRRRRRR
